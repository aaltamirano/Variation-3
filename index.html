			<br> From <br> childhood's 
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
			hour <br> I <br> have <br> not <br> been
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As <br> others <br> were -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- I <br> have <br> not <br> seen
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As <br> others <br> saw -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> - <br> I <br> could <br> not <br> bring
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My <br> passions <br> from <br> a <br> common <br> spring <br> -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> same <br> source <br> I <br> have <br> not <br> taken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My <br> sorrow -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <br> I <br> could <br> not <br> awaken
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> My <br> heart <br> to <br> joy <br> at <br> the <br> same <br> tone -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			<br> And <br> all <br> I <br> lov'd -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <br> I <br> lov'd <br> alone <br> -&nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Then -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> - <br> in <br> my <br> childhood -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- <br> in <br> the <br> dawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Of <br> a <br> most <br> stormy <br> life -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> - <br> was <br> drawn
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> ev'ry <br> depth <br> of <br> good <br> and <br> ill
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> The <br> mystery <br> which <br> binds <br> me <br> still -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> torrent, <br> or <br> the <br> fountain -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> red <br> cliff <br> of <br> the <br> mountain -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> sun <br> that <br> 'round <br> me <br> roll'd
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> In <br> its <br> autumn <br> tint <br> of <br> gold -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> lightning <br> in <br> the <br> sky
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> As <br> it <br> pass'd <br> me <br> flying <br> by -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> From <br> the <br> thunder, <br> and <br> the <br> storm -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> And <br> the <br> cloud <br> that <br> took <br> the <br> form
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> (When <br> the <br> rest <br> of <br> Heaven <br> was <br> blue)
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
			<br> Of <br> a <br> demon <br> in <br> my <br> view <br> -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-
